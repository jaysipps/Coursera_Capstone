I chose this because I feel like this is a realistic and somewhat common business proposal, so there may be real world results that can use my findings for their future business proposals.

A close proximity to a cannabis dispensary would make an excellent selling point for the location. This data should help me accurately suggest a neighborhood for the bakery business. Once I analyze the foursquare data, I can use it to differentiate multiple neighborhoods that may fit both of these prerequisites. I can further sort by accessibility from major hotspots such as malls for example."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "##### I will webscrape neighborhood data from Wikipedia and filter the results to include only L8 and L9 postal codes for the Hamilton area.
